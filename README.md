# simple-neuralnet-python

A simple neural network using Python. Made mostly as an experiment and practice.

## Usage

Currently just run `python neuralnet.py` (TODO: Read data from a csv-file). The networks trains using some training data, then classifies test data. On the command line the testing data outputs are printed. The data used can be seen from `main()`.

## Tests
The simplest way to run tests is running `nosetests -v` in the main directory. Nose must be installed for this to work.
